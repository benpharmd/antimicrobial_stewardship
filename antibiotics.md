# Classification by mechanism of action

## Cell wall synthesis inhibitors
Prevention of cell wall synthesis leads to cell lysis
- penicillins
- cephalosporins
- carbapenems

## Protein synthesis inhibitors
Disruption of bacterial ribosome, which interferes with protein synthesis 
- aminoglycosides
- macrolides
- tetracyclines

## DNA/RNA synthesis inhibitors 
Disruption of DNA/RNA synthesis to prevent DNA/RNA replication and transcription
- quinolones
- metronidazole

## Metabolic inhibitors
Production of essential metabolites disrupted
- sulfonamides
- trimethoprim

## Membrane disruptors
Disruption of bacterial membrane, leading to membrane leaks and cell death
- daptomycin
- polymixins
