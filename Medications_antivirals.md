# Classification by mechanism of action

## Nucleoside/nucleotide analogues
These meds mimic natural nucleotides, interfering with viral DNA/RNA synthesis, preventing replication
- acyclovir
- valacyclovir
- tenofovir

## Protease inhibitors
Interference with vial protease enzyme, preventing viral maturation and release
- ritonavir
- darunavir
- lopinavir

## Fusion inhibitors
Meds that block the fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membrance, preventing entry and replication
- enfuvirtide
- maraviroc

## Neuraminidase inhibitors
Blocking of neuraminidase enzyme, preventing release of new viral particles from infected cells
- oseltamivir
- zanamivir

## Polymerase inhibitors
Prevention of viral replication by targeting viral polymerase 
- sofosbuvir
- ribavirin
