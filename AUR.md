# Antimicrobial Use and Antimicrobial Resistance 

- Give sufficient time for cultures to result (~7 days after end of month) before compiling/submitting data
- 3rd party vendors will do this for you
- The CDC has comprehensive lists for [AU vendors](https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/cdaportal/sds/au-vendor-list.html) as well as [AR vendors](https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/cdaportal/sds/ar-vendor-list.html)


## NHSN AUR: definitions, codes, locations, reporting plan

### Definitions
days present -- denominator (definition 
--> catches anything at any point in time
--> if a patient transfers units, they will be in each unit as a days present, but 1 days present at the facility total for that day
patient days -- facility usually counts where X-patient is at Y-time of day

### Location Mapping

### Monthly Reporting Plan

### Data Validation
- If using a 3rd party vendor, export your denominator by unit/facility and numerator by unit/facility
- Validate 20-30 patients (until you feel comfortable with it)
- Look for patients with a really long stay (a month or two length of stay)
- Check for first doses in ED vs Inpt (eg. patient status)

### AR Validation
